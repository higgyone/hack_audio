Python code for hack audio book by Eric Tarr

This is hack-y python code that ports the original MatLab code. It works but no guarentees on quality> I did enough to get it working and understand the concepts in the book.

I highly recommend the book so go and buy it!

I will not be updating this repo anymore.
